# Material 3 Button Showcase with Lottie & Neumorphism ✨

This project is a **comprehensive showcase of Material 3 Buttons, Expressive Button Groups, Lottie Animations**, and **Neumorphism UI** using **Jetpack Compose**. It is designed to help Android developers understand the usage, styling, and interaction capabilities of modern UI components provided by **Material Design 3 (M3)**.

---

## 🚀 Features Explored

### 🧩 Material 3 Buttons

All types of Material 3 buttons have been implemented and demonstrated:

- `Button`
- `ElevatedButton`
- `FilledTonalButton`

### 🎨 Lottie Animations

This project also explores **Lottie animations** including:

- 🔧 How to implement Lottie in Jetpack Compose using `lottie-compose`
- 🌈 How to change the color of the entire animation
- 🎯 How to target and change colors of **individual parts** of the animation using `LottieDynamicProperties`

---

### 🧊 Neumorphism UI

Neumorphism is a hybrid design concept combining **Skeuomorphism** and **Flat Design**. It’s implemented using subtle:

- ☁️ Light shadows
- 🌑 Dark shadows
- 🎨 Soft backgrounds and rounded surfaces

This project demonstrates how to create **Neumorphic buttons** and containers using Compose modifiers.
